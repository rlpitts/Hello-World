# Hello-World
misc. code dump

I did not write coordconv.py, but formatter.py needs it to work and it's open source. See coordconv.py file for license.

I designed formatter.py specifically to homogenize the spacecraft and other MIR/FIR/sub-mm data I downloaded, organized the way I found most convenient on my work PC. It is unlikely to be useful as-is for anyone else, except perhaps as examples of how to solve a very specific set of problems, but I busted my ass to get it to do what I needed done, dammit. I'm keeping it here primarily as an online record of my work. If it helps anyone else in any way, that's just icing on the cake.
