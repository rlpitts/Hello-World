# Hello-World
misc. code dump

I did not write coordconv.py, but formatter.py needs it to work and it's open source. See coordconv.py file for license.

I designed formatter.py specifically to homogenize the spacecraft and other MIR/FIR/sub-mm data I downloaded from IRSA and organize it the way I found most convenient on my workstation. It is unlikely to be useful to run as-is from the top, but individual modules may be helpful to copy wholesale or in part. I'm keeping it here primarily as an online record of my work. If it helps anyone else in any way, that's just icing on the cake.
